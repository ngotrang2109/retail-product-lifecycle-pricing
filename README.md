# Retail Product Lifecycle & Pricing Strategy

## 1. 📌Overview
This personal project analyzes retail sales and inventory data to support product lifecycle management, pricing strategy, inventory planning and operational decision-making.

The project is designed from a **Business Analyst (Retail / Operations)** perspective, focusing on business logic, data-driven insights and process improvement commonly applied in real retail environments.

## 2. 🔍Business Problems
Retail businesses often face:
- Static pricing applied across different product stages.
- Inventory imbalance causing stock shortages or excess stock.
- Slow operational and marketing response to sales trends.

---

## 3. 🎯Business Objectives
- Enable lifecycle-based pricing and inventory decisions.
- Reduce inventory risks through demand forecasting.
- Improve operational efficiency with automated workflows.

---

## 4. 🎯Scope
- In Scope: Product lifecycle classification, pricing strategy, demand forecasting, operational process improvements.  
- Out of Scope: Supplier negotiation, POS system integration.

---

## 5. ✍️Solution Summary
The solution classifies products by lifecycle and role to drive pricing, inventory and demand forecasting decisions.

### 🔁 Product Lifecycle Classification
Products are classified into lifecycle stages based on sales trends, sales volume and product age:
- New: Newly launched products
- Growth: Products showing strong and increasing sales performance.
- Maturity: Products with high and stable sales, indicating market saturation.
- Decline: Products experiencing consistent sales decline.

Lifecycle classification supports differentiated pricing and inventory strategies.


## 🔑 Key & Potential Product Identification
In addition to lifecycle classification, products are further categorized into Key and Potential groups based on revenue contribution, sales performance, and growth signals.
- Key Products: High sales volume and stable performance (core revenue and traffic drivers).
- Potential Products: Products showing positive growth signals with opportunities for scaling (marketing seeds).
- Other Products: Products in maturity with low growth or in decline stages.

This classification enables targeted pricing, inventory and marketing actions.


## 💰 Pricing Strategy
Pricing strategies are aligned with lifecycle stage and product role:
- Key / Growth products: price stability and inventory priority
- Potential products: promotional pricing to drive volume
- Decline products: clearance pricing to reduce inventory


## 📈 Demand Forecasting & Restock Planning
A simple demand forecasting approach is applied using historical sales trends:
- Moving average–based forecasting
- Forecast results combined with inventory levels
- Restock suggestions generated by product role and lifecycle stage
This helps reduce stockout and overstock risks.


## 🔁 Process Improvement & Workflow Design
### Production Planning Workflow
Sales performance and inventory thresholds trigger production planning reviews, reducing manual monitoring and delays.
### Marketing Reaction Workflow
Fast-growing products are identified early to support timely marketing actions such as promotions or campaigns.

These rule-based workflows improve operational efficiency and response time.

## 📊 Data Sources
Simulated omnichannel retail data:
- Sales transactions (in-store and online)
- Inventory levels
- Product master data

### Key Fields
| Field | Description |
|------|------------|
| product_id | Product identifier |

## 🔗 Data Integration & Transformation (SQL)
Sales and inventory data from multiple sources are integrated and aggregated using SQL.

Key activities:
- Monthly sales aggregation
- Average inventory calculation
- Data joining using CTEs

```sql
WITH sales_monthly AS (
    SELECT
        product_id,
        DATE_TRUNC('month', sales_date) AS month,
        SUM(quantity_sold) AS total_sales
    FROM sales
    GROUP BY product_id, DATE_TRUNC('month', sales_date)
),
inventory_avg AS (
    SELECT
        product_id,
        DATE_TRUNC('month', inventory_date) AS month,
        AVG(inventory_level) AS avg_inventory
    FROM inventory
    GROUP BY product_id, DATE_TRUNC('month', inventory_date)
)
SELECT
    s.product_id,
    s.month,
    s.total_sales,
    i.avg_inventory
FROM sales_monthly s
LEFT JOIN inventory_avg i
ON s.product_id = i.product_id
AND s.month = i.month;
```
